## About Me
I have knowledge of the software development life cycle, various development methodologies (Agile values and Scrum approach)

I understand the structures of the client server applications, the purpose of the HTTP (s) protocol, the structure of the request / response, and the HTTP methods.

I’m ready to compensate the lack of work experience in web development by quick learning, curiosity, perseverance, high productivity and communication skills. I’m a strong team player.

## Work experience
My work experience is basically related to HR function (in FMCG, Retail, International airport) – I’ve been working in budgeting and reporting streams starting from 2014 on various positions (beginning as specialist, growing to a head of department with 4 direct reports). 

During my career I have been always participating in cross-functional IT projects on implementation of new systems and tools or upgrade to a new version.

My main focus was identification of business/user needs, validation of system requirements specification, testing (functional, regression and integration testing), analysis of defects and control of their fixing, user acceptance testing and preparation for product deployment (communication campaign, writing user manuals and conducting end-user trainings).
