                            <span>
                                I've been studying web development since 2020.
                                Since then I have gained solid understanding of
                                the software development life cycle, various
                                development methodologies (Agile values and
                                Scrum approach), version control management
                                systems (Git), QA principles, the structures of
                                the client server applications, and the
                                structure of the request / response and the HTTP
                                methods. Of course as I'm interested in frontend
                                development I enjoy learning HTML/CSS/JS a lot
                                (please see some of projects here). I'm ready to
                                compensate the lack of work experience in web
                                development by quick learning, curiosity,
                                perseverance, high productivity and
                                communication skills. I'm a strong team player.

                    <h2>work experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        My work experience is basically related to HR function
                        (in FMCG, Retail, International airport) – I’ve been
                        working in budgeting and reporting streams starting from
                        2014 on various positions (beginning as specialist,
                        growing to a head of department with 4 direct reports).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my career I have been always participating in
                        cross-functional IT projects on implementation of new
                        systems and tools or upgrade to a new version. My main
                        focus was identification of business/user needs,
                        validation of system requirements specification, testing
                        (functional, regression and integration testing),
                        analysis of defects and control of their fixing, user
                        acceptance testing and preparation for product
                        deployment (communication campaign, writing user manuals
                        and conducting end-user trainings).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it started to seem to me complicated (building and
                        deploying standalone applications) after one project,
                        where we developed a solution, which allowed to use web
                        browser. That was the moment when I started to take a
                        deep interest in web development and my journey began!
